## Project Description

This project investigates pricing strategies to help businesses maintain market competitiveness while protecting profit margins. Using sales and competitor pricing data, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights on optimal pricing adjustments and categories requiring real-time monitoring. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to maximize market share and safeguard future sales, ensuring both competitiveness and profitability.
